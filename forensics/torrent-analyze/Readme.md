## Description
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network.
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network. Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}

## Approach
We're given a torrent.pcap() file. As this is a torrent challenge, I went to Wireshark and enabled the BitTorrent DHT Protocol (BT-DHT) by going to `Analyze -> Enabled Protocol`.

The overall packet capture looks like the following,

I applied the `bt-dht` filter, and looked through the packets, and saw that some contained `info_hash`.

The challenge only wants us to find the file name, and not reconstruct the file, so I knew that this `info_hash` information will be very important because it tells us the hash of the file. As `hash` is `68 61 73 68` in hex, I inputted this hex value into the Wireshark search to look for all packets that contained this hash information.

The first packet that contained `info_hash` was packet 79 with a hash value of `17d62de1495d4404f6fb385bdfd7ead5c897ea22`

<img width="967" alt="79" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/205495410-03c8604f-cf93-4b43-8eba-e20c98c6f842.png">

So I looked up `17d62de1495d4404f6fb385bdfd7ead5c897ea22` on Google, and saw that it corresponded to `Awakened.2013.1080p.BluRay.X264-iNVANDRAREN`.

The first packet that contained `info_hash` was packet 332 with a hash value of `17c1e42e811a83f12c697c21bed9c72b5cb3000d`

<img width="839" alt="332" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/205495435-58d610e8-cb4c-47b4-9520-c6fa854adffe.png"> 

This file corresponded to `name: Zoo (2017) 720p WEB-DL x264 ESubs - MkvHub.Com`.

I looked through a few more, and I was at packet 51080 which had a hash value of `e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e`.

I Googled this, and saw that it corresponded to `ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso` from [LinuxTracker.org](https://linuxtracker.org/index.php?page=torrent-details&id=e2467cbf021192c241367b892230dc1e05c0580e).

<img width="776" alt="flag" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87711310/205495491-464df5ba-01e9-4d17-8c19-b0159939b435.png">


Therefore, the flag is,

`picoCTF{ubuntu-19.10-desktop-amd64.iso}`
